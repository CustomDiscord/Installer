# CustomDiscord Installer
So you want to install the superior DiscordApp client modification? Well, you're in the right place!
## Installing
So if you're using the superior package manager, [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), you can run the following commands in a command prompt or terminal.  
```bash
yarn global add customdiscord-installer
customdiscord install
```
And it's that simple!  
If you're using [npm](https://npmjs.com), you can run these commands in a command prompt or terminal.  
```bash
npm i --global customdiscord-installer
customdiscord install
```
## Uninstalling
Why would you want to do this? But, if you really insist...
```bash
customdiscord uninstall
```
After running these commands, CustomDiscord is completely uninstalled from your Discord installation.
## Updating
Updating is quite simple too!
```bash
customdiscord update
```
How easy was that?
